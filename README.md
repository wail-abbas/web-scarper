# Web Scraping

## About
This is a web scarper app to extract the hotel data from Booking.com.

## Important Note:
This code have been implemented and tested with an old HTML file, so it will not work for the current website of Booking.com.

## How it run
Inside the project's directory run the app using the following command:
```bash
python3 web_scarper.py <html_path> <output_path>
```
	
Where:

html_path : is the full path to the HTML file
output_path: is the path where you want to save the output file

The JSON file with the hotel's name will be saved in the output_path.
